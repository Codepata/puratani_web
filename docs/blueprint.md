## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep black (#000000) for a stark, sophisticated aesthetic.
- Background color: Soft Gray (#F2F2F2), a slightly desaturated near-white hue providing contrast but not starkness, allowing elements to pop against the background.
- Accent color: Pink (#D81B60), offering a vibrant highlight for key interactive elements; it complements the primary color and reflects the specified design system. This color is chosen in the hue neighborhood to the user requested primary color (#E91E63), but with adjustments for maximum contrast and visual harmony.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that offers both a modern look and a touch of warmth.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern sans-serif for headlines, with a high-end feel. Pair with PT Sans for body.
- Use a set of clear, minimalist icons from a consistent set (e.g., Feather, Phosphor). Match icons to primary color.
- Employ a mobile-first, responsive layout with touch-friendly components and consistent spacing throughout the app. Use expo and tailwind CSS
- Subtle animations using Reanimated 2 for transitions, button hovers, and other interactive elements.
